# Question 2

## Results

* Tensorflow keras sequential model with 1 dense layer and sigmoid activation and binary cross_entropy loss for 150 epochs and a batch_size of 30 gave the accuracy score of
    * Accuracy Score for lambda 0 = <?>
    * Accuracy Score for lambda 0 = <?>

* The results obtained are simialr to question 1 as we are creating a single layer neural netowrk which behaves as a sigmoid function.
